Inshallah this is my notes folder for every thing. i am going to save it on git and place allllllll my notes
--my web articles
--my brain stroms
--diary
--snippets
allllllllllllllllllllllllll

The main purpose of this endevour is 

--1-- All and everything specially written text and images.
--2-- i will not use a database since it has to be textbase and has to be kept simple (I can however use comma seperate files or json files, i can load my entire file)
--3-- KEEP IT simple
--4-- use normal webpages with javascript and web-components.
--5--in the past I have created a code base system. That became too complicated so now all i will use is simple webpages and a manually build home page, nothing more no react no database.
--6-- The word code base means that this will serve as a base for any future complex and modern system but this itself will be very simple and non-technical.
--7-- i will bring my entire code base here just copt the pages
