    <h1>What I learnt Today</h1>
<p>Today I worked on creating lit elements and animating them.I learnt following:</p>    
<p>To animate all we need is to add a <b>transition</b>  property to the CSS of an element and when ever we change any of its proeprty (provided that  property is mentioned in the transition proeprty) it will be animated.</p>
<p>Secondly if we want to change the CSS of a lit element based in a variable (javascript variable) all we have to do is move the styling from top to the render function and insert this styling inside <b>style</b> tags. On the top the css is returned by satic getter so that is uniform for every instance of the lit element class but if we put it in render function then we can change it every time </p>
