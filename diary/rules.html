<h2>What Why and How of Bilzaa Notes</h2>    
<p>This repository is my notes folder for every thing. I have been writing notes for years, however I keep loosing them since they do not have one simple home. This is a one-stop solution for all my notes taking needs. Also these notes are shared online with other people so that they can take help from it.</p> 

<p>The main purpose of this endevour is:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Store all and everything specially written text, images, snippets etc. Any thing that can be saved as html file should be saved.</li>   
<li>It will not use a database since it has to be textbase and has to be kept simple (I can however use comma seperate files or json files, such that we can use then as replacement of database)</li>
<li>KEEP IT simple.</li>
<li>Use normal webpages with javascript , html and CSS</li>
<li>Use of web-components is allowed</li>
<li>Any change in the codebase that prevents me from just moving the folder from one place to another is prohibited</li>
<li>In the past I have created a code base system. That became too complicated so now all i will use is simple webpages and a manually build home page, nothing more no react no database</li>
<li>The word code base means that this will serve as a base for any future complex and modern system but this itself will be very simple and non-technical.</li>
</ol>   
    <h1>Here are the Rules for This Codebase System</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>Keep it very simple</b>. By simplei mean I can add javascript and CSS but no server side database etc etc. Any thing that prevents me from copy pasting this folder to another place it prohibited. No PHP, react etc just HMTL, javascript and CSS.</li>
<li>How do I know if the system is simple engough? Well here are the criteria: 1: You should be able to copy and paste this folder any where without any tooling or server setup and this should work fine. 2: This should be able to be dragged onto  a server and become a ready made blog (quick and dirty blog)</li>
<li><b>Improve Forward, Support Backword:</b> Never add new things to old pages, once a page is written just let it be, if there is some improvement just add it to the future pages.</li>
<li><b>This is not a folder but internet</b> Just like all pages on internet do not look same and work the same similarly this folder is not suppose to be uniform, it just has to be linked, every page must have atleast one link out of it, the index.html can have millions of links and will serve as a database.</li>

</ol>
