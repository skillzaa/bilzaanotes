    <h1>Here are the Rules for This Codebase System</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>Keep it very simple</b>. By simplei mean I can add javascript and CSS but no server side database etc etc. Any thing that prevents me from copy pasting this folder to another place it prohibited. No PHP, react etc just HMTL, javascript and CSS.</li>
<li>How do I know if the system is simple engough? Well here are the criteria: 1: You should be able to copy and paste this folder any where without any tooling or server setup and this should work fine. 2: This should be able to be dragged onto  a server and become a ready made blog (quick and dirty blog)</li>
<li><b>Improve Forward, Support Backword:</b> Never add new things to old pages, once a page is written just let it be, if there is some improvement just add it to the future pages.</li>
<li><b>This is not a folder but internet</b> Just like all pages on internet do not look same and work the same similarly this folder is not suppose to be uniform, it just has to be linked, every page must have atleast one link out of it, the index.html can have millions of links and will serve as a database.</li>

</ol>
